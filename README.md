# Producer-driven Contract + Consumer-Driven Contract tests Sample - Client application
Sample application to demonstrate the use of Producer Driven Contract and Consumer Driven Contract tests with SpringBoot 2.3.0 + Spring Cloud Contract 2.2 - Client/contract consumer sample application.

This application uses:

- Spring Boot 2.3.0
- Spring Cloud Hoxton.SR4
- Spring Cloud Contract 2.2
- Spring Web+Rest
- Lombok
- Java 8
- Gradle (Gradle wrapper)
- JUnit 5 e Mockito
- Open Feign
- StubRunner (will run in local mode, on port 8082)
- WireMock

You can see the server / REST API provider application here: https://github.com/bovino/spring_cloud_contract_server_api_sample

# TODO List for this sample project

- Adding Docker and maybe Kubernetes support
- Adding continuos integration with Jenkins (or similars)
- Adding code validation with SonarQube (or similars)
- Adding more contract sample with others DSLs instead of only Groovy (Yaml, Java and Kotlin)
- Implement a Consumer-driven sample using an Angular application + Pact
- using a remote StubRunner instead of a local one
- publishing the contracts to a Git repository instead of using Maven local repo
- adding a video-tutorial showing all the steps from the beginning, starting with the generation of the codebase from Spring Initializer
 - Do you have other ideas for improvements? Please tell me! Reach out to me on Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/bovino/


# Getting Started
This application uses Gradle (Gradle wrapper) and a few useful commands are:

- ##### Basic Build: <code>gradlew clean build</code>
- ##### Publish (includes generation and publish of contract stubs for your local maven repository): <code>gradlew clean publishToMavenLocal</code>
- ##### Run tests (including the contract tests): <code>gradlew clean test</code>

Before using this application you will need:

- Some IDE with Lombok support (i like IntelliJ)
- Any Rest API client (i like Postman)
- JDK 1.8,0_251 or newer
- Configure your JAVA_HOME environment variable
- You need the ports 8080 (server API), 8081 (client API) and 8082 (local StubRunner) to be free
